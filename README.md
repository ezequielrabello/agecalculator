This challenge was about building an Age Calculator App. This application allows you to check your age, detailing exactly how many years, months, and days you are.

## ðŸ›  Technologies 
This project was developed with the following technologies:
- ### Javascript
  â–¶ On JS, you will see that there are a lot of conditions to make calculations about years, months, and days. It has validations that require the user to provide an answer in every field and make sure it won't be empty. Also, it was necessary to make sure that all the answers given by the user would be appropriate to the month and year. For example, answering dates to a month that doesn't have those many days or a date that hasn't come yet.       
- ### HTML
  â–¶ On HTML, I was able to organize my code and anticipate myself for future ideas that might have shown up during coding. 
- ### CSS
  â–¶ On CSS, It was possible to practice more concepts about @media() and improve my responsive layout skills.
